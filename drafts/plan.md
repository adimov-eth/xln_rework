# Phase 1: MVP Development and Testnet Launch

This phase focuses on building a minimal viable product (MVP) with core functionality for a reserve-credit system, simple entity and channel management, and launching it on a testnet. The plan is designed to establish a solid foundation over approximately 28 weeks (7 months).

## Step-by-Step Plan

### Step 1: Define Core Scope and Requirements (Weeks 1-2)
**Objective:** Establish a clear scope for the MVP to ensure focused development.

**Activities:**
- Define minimal features for the reserve-credit system:
  - Users can deposit tokens into reserves
  - Users can allocate reserves to channels as collateral
  - Set basic credit limits for channels
  - Enable simple payment transactions within channels
- Limit entity types to single-signer entities (e.g., personal wallets)
- Define basic channel functionality for direct payments between two entities
- Exclude complex features like swaps or multi-signer entities
- Document security, state management, and interface requirements

**Deliverables:**
- MVP feature list and scope document
- High-level architecture diagram

### Step 2: Set Up Development Environment and Tools (Weeks 3-4)
**Objective:** Create a robust environment for development and testing.

**Activities:**
- Set up version control (e.g., Git) and project management tools (e.g., GitHub)
- Configure tools for smart contract development (e.g., Hardhat)
- Establish CI/CD pipelines for automated testing and deployment
- Launch a local Ethereum testnet (e.g., Hardhat Network)
- Integrate libraries like ethers.js for blockchain interactions

**Deliverables:**
- Fully configured development environment
- Operational CI/CD pipeline
- Running local testnet

### Step 3: Implement Core Smart Contracts (Weeks 5-10)
**Objective:** Develop the foundational smart contracts for the MVP.

**Activities:**
- Depository Contract:
  - Enable token deposits and withdrawals
  - Allow reserve allocation to channels as collateral
  - Include basic debt settlement logic
- Entity Contract:
  - Support single-signer entities
  - Use Merkle trees for basic state management
- Channel Contract:
  - Enable bilateral channels with state tracking
  - Support opening, funding, and closing channels
  - Facilitate simple in-channel payments

**Deliverables:**
- Smart contracts for Depository, Entity, and Channel
- Unit tests for all contracts

### Step 4: Develop Off-Chain Components (Weeks 11-14)
**Objective:** Build supporting off-chain services for the smart contracts.

**Activities:**
- Server Implementation:
  - Aggregate messages and create transaction maps
  - Generate blocks and Merkle trees
- Signer Implementation:
  - Manage private keys and sign transactions
  - Handle simple consensus for single-signer entities
- API Development:
  - Create RESTful APIs for system interaction (e.g., deposit, open channel)
  - Secure APIs with token-based authentication

**Deliverables:**
- Off-chain server and signer services
- Documented API endpoints

### Step 5: Integrate Front-End Interface (Weeks 15-16)
**Objective:** Provide a basic interface for MVP interaction.

**Activities:**
- Build a web interface to:
  - Manage reserves (deposit/withdraw)
  - Create/manage entities
  - Open/fund channels
  - Process payments within channels
- Integrate with a wallet (e.g., MetaMask) for transaction signing
- Ensure usability for developers and testers

**Deliverables:**
- Functional front-end interface
- User guide for the interface

### Step 6: Implement State Management and Storage (Weeks 17-18)
**Objective:** Ensure reliable state handling and persistence.

**Activities:**
- Use LevelDB for state and block storage
- Implement in-memory state management with periodic snapshots
- Develop state loading/saving logic
- Verify correct state transitions during transactions

**Deliverables:**
- State management module
- Snapshot mechanism for recovery

### Step 7: Testing and Quality Assurance (Weeks 19-22)
**Objective:** Validate the MVP for stability and correctness.

**Activities:**
- Unit Testing: Test smart contracts and off-chain components individually
- Integration Testing: Verify end-to-end flows (e.g., deposit to payment)
- Security Testing: Check for vulnerabilities (e.g., reentrancy)
- Performance Testing: Simulate small-scale usage (e.g., 100 entities)

**Deliverables:**
- Test reports and coverage metrics
- Bug fixes and optimizations

### Step 8: Documentation and Developer Resources (Weeks 23-24)
**Objective:** Equip developers and testers with necessary resources.

**Activities:**
- Write detailed API documentation
- Create tutorials for setup and MVP usage
- Document architecture and workflows
- Prepare a testnet deployment guide

**Deliverables:**
- Comprehensive API documentation
- Developer tutorials and guides

### Step 9: Testnet Deployment (Weeks 25-26)
**Objective:** Launch the MVP on a public testnet.

**Activities:**
- Deploy smart contracts to an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia)
- Set up public servers and signers
- Configure the front-end for testnet access
- Announce the launch to the developer community

**Deliverables:**
- Operational testnet deployment
- Public access instructions

### Step 10: Community Engagement and Feedback Collection (Weeks 27-28)
**Objective:** Collect feedback to refine the MVP.

**Activities:**
- Monitor testnet usage and bug reports
- Engage with users via forums or GitHub
- Conduct a feedback survey
- Plan updates for Phase 2 based on input

**Deliverables:**
- Feedback report
- Updated roadmap for Phase 2

## Timeline Summary

**Total Duration:** 28 weeks (7 months)

**Key Milestones:**
- Week 2: MVP scope finalized
- Week 10: Smart contracts completed
- Week 16: Front-end interface ready
- Week 22: Testing finished
- Week 26: Testnet launched
- Week 28: Feedback collected, Phase 2 planning begins

This plan ensures a structured approach to building and launching the MVP, focusing on core functionality while laying the groundwork for future enhancements. Each step builds on the previous one, with testing and community feedback integrated to refine the system.
